Becoming a MERN stack developer in 4 weeks is an intensive sprint, not a marathon, but absolutely achievable to get a solid foundation if you dedicate serious time.\n\nAs your Senior Career Mentor, let's craft a focused, actionable roadmap to bridge that gap!\n\n---\n\n### **🎯 Your Goal: Become a MERN Stack Developer**\n### **📈 Current Skills: HTML, CSS**\n### **⏳ Timeline: 4 Weeks (Intensive Sprint!)**\n\n---\n\n### **Mentor's Opening Advice:**\n\n\"Welcome to the MERN journey! This 4-week roadmap is designed to immerse you deeply into the stack. Be prepared for a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience. Consistency is key, and don't be afraid to struggle – that's where true learning happens. Remember to leverage online resources heavily, and don't just copy-paste code; *understand* it. Version control (Git/GitHub) should be your best friend from day one. Let's build some amazing things!\"\n\n---\n\n### **🗓️ Week 1: JavaScript Fundamentals & DOM Mastery**\n\nThis week is all about building the bedrock of everything else.
